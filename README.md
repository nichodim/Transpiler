# Transpiler
This project retrieves source code from the file text.txt file. This source is meant to be written in Visual BASIC in order to be converted into usable C code. This is done through the lexer, which converts the source into a vector of tokens, parser which chains the Visual BASIC logic, and the emitter forming and outputting the converted code into another file.
